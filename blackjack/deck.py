"""
A 'deck' is a collection of playing cards
Recall that we have 4 different suits of playing cards and 13 different ranks
Meaning that a deck is the set of 52 unique combinations of rank + suit

Create a deck class which:
- Holds this set of 52 unique combinations of rank + suit
- Can be shuffled to obtain a unique ordering of these cards
- Can have cards dealt from it (removes the card from its state)
