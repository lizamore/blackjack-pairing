"""
In blackjack a hand is initially dealt as 2 cards
A player is then able to optionally request additional cards until they 'bust'
A hand is considered 'bust' if it exceeds the value of 21

Create a hand class which is able to:
- Holds the state of the hand in terms of which cards it is made up of
- Can get the current value of the hand (the sum of the ranks)
- Can determine whether the hand has 'bust' or not (is it over 21?)
